# Script JS optimisation notes

Could always add Async / await here too. Why? For API fetch function - returnMovies()
1. Easier to read code
2. Error handling - trying and catching
3. Sequentilal execution, makes sure operations are complete before going to next step.
4. Performance optimisation - probably not much of a difference with a project this size
