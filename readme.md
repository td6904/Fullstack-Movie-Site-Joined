Part 3 - Joining both sides, of a tutorial I finished to develop the front and back ends then the connection between both sides.

Video tutorial followed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu_pCVPKzTk Full Stack Web Development for Beginners (Full Course on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB)

Works well, with a couple of errors: if you try and write a review and it contains an apostrophe in either the user or the review boxes then it doesn't get sent to the DB.

Really had fun making this.

Again, the back end is working from replit and not the local repo but once I get more experience I will go back and tweak it.
